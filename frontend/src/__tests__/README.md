### Test Data Examples
```javascript
// Sample appointment data
const appointmentData = {
  _id: 'appointment123',
  docData: {
    name: 'Dr. Smith',
    speciality: 'Cardiology',
    fees: 500,
    type: 'Private'
  },
  slotDate: '15_12_2024',
  slotTime: '10:00',
  amount: 500,
  payment: 'pending',
  cancelled: false,
  isCompleted: false
};

// Sample doctor slots
const doctorSlots = {
  '15_12_2024': ['10:00', '11:00'],
  '16_12_2024': ['09:00']
};
```

## Notes
- Tests focus on business logic and utility functions
- React component tests are simplified to avoid import.meta issues
- All tests are isolated and don't require external dependencies
- Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
- Comprehensive validation of appointment management workflows
